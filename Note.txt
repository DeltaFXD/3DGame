For efficiency purposes, XMVECTOR values can be passed as arguments to functions in SSE/SSE2 registers instead of on the stack.
To do this in a platform independent way, we use the types FXMVECTOR, GXMVECTOR, HXMVECTOR and CXMVECTOR for passing XMVECTOR parameters.
Then the rule for passing XMVECTOR parameters is that the first three XMVECTOR parameters should be of type FXMVECTOR;
the fourth XMVECTOR should be of type GXMVECTOR; the fifth and sixth XMVECTOR parameter should be of type HXMVECTOR;
and any additional XMVECTOR parameters should be of type CXMVECTOR.

Just as we use XMFLOAT2 (2D), XMFLOAT3 (3D), and XMFLOAT4 (4D) when storing vectors in a class, it is recommended, by the DirectXMath documentation to
use the XMFLOAT4X4 type to store matrices as class data members.
